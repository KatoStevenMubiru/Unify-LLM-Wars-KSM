# Unify-LLM-Wars

**Project Description:**
Your task is to develop a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) application where two LLMs engage in a battle by challenging each other with prompts. The flow of application:
1. LL1 suggests a prompt.
2. LLM2 answers.
3. LL1 verifies the answer.
4. A judge LLM evaluates. If LLM2 is wrong, the app stops and LLM1 is declared the winner. Otherwise, 
5. LL2 suggests a prompt, and the cycle repeats. 

Users should be able to:
- Select competing LLMs and a judge LLM.
- Visualize the competition.
